#Project Description

RedRun is a first-person multiplayer game in which a group of victims attempt to make it to the end of a deadly obstacle course littered with traps. Players choose the role of good or evil in the form of victims and villains. Victims are part of team blue and try to trick the villains into springing the traps at the wrong time. Villains are part of team red and try to outwit the victims by springing the traps at the right time. If even a single victim makes it to the end of the obstacle course unscathed the blue team wins. If the villains eliminate all of the victims then the red team wins.
